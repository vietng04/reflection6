# Sale difference between Loblaws and Voila

## Overview

This repository is designed to support an analysis of sales data from two grocery vendors: Loblaws and Voila. The focus is on examining the price differences between products, specifically looking at items marked as "on sale." The project aims to explore whether there are instances where the price is artificially increased before a sale, only to return to normal afterward. This dataset provides a foundation for analyzing pricing trends, comparing the impact of sales on product pricing, and identifying patterns in promotional pricing strategies across different vendors.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:
-   'data' clean data that is used througout the paper
