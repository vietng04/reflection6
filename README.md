# Price Analysis of “Apples Ambrosia” Across Vendors

## Overview
This project analyzes the pricing strategies for Apples Ambrosia across two grocery vendors, NoFrills and Loblaws. The study aims to understand whether there is evidence of price manipulation practices, such as artificially inflating prices before a sale period to create the appearance of a significant discount. The results are based on observed prices during sale and non-sale periods at NoFrills and consistent regular prices at Loblaws.


## Analysis Summary
The analysis focuses on two key areas:

	1.	Price Manipulation at NoFrills:
	•	NoFrills exhibits a pattern where the price of Apples Ambrosia is initially elevated to $6.49 (the “old price”) before being discounted to $5.49 during sale periods. This consistent discount suggests a fixed price reduction strategy.
	•	The regular price at NoFrills might be artificially inflated before the sale, creating an illusion of a larger discount when the price drops by $1.00 during promotional periods.
	2.	Stable Pricing at Loblaws:
	•	Loblaws maintains a stable current price of $5.49 without fluctuations, indicating no reliance on sale-driven price manipulation.
	•	The consistent pricing strategy at Loblaws suggests a transparent approach that may appeal to consumers who value stability and straightforward pricing.

## Limitations and Further Research
This analysis is limited to a single product and two vendors. Future studies could expand to include additional products, different time periods, and a wider variety of grocery chains. Further statistical testing would be beneficial to determine the significance of observed price differences and validate the findings on price manipulation.
