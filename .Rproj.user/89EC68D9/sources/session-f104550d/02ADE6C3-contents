abstract: "This study investigates the pricing of Ambrosia apples at two major grocery retailers, Loblaws and NoFrills, to determine the validity of advertised sales. Loblaws claims to offer Ambrosia apples at a discounted price of $1.21 per unit, reduced from an original price of $1.45. However, a comparison with NoFrills shows that the price of Ambrosia apples is consistently $1.21, without any mention of a sale. This suggests that Loblaws' ‘sale’ may not represent a true discount but rather a temporary reduction to match NoFrills' regular pricing. These findings raise questions about the transparency of sale promotions and highlight the need for consumers to be vigilant when comparing prices."

# Introduction

Retailers frequently promote products as being "on sale" to attract consumers. However, these promotions may not always represent a genuine discount. This paper investigates the pricing of Ambrosia apples at two major Canadian grocery chains, Loblaws and NoFrills. Specifically, Loblaws advertises a sale price of $1.21 per unit, reduced from an original price of $1.45. Meanwhile, NoFrills consistently offers the same apples at $1.21, without labeling it as a sale. This study explores whether Loblaws' claimed discount reflects an actual price reduction or simply aligns with competitors' regular prices, raising questions about pricing transparency.The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether Loblaws' advertised sale price on Ambrosia apples represents a genuine discount. We estimate the validity of this sale by comparing prices across two vendors—Loblaws and NoFrills—and investigating if the "original" price at Loblaws was artificially inflated before the sale. The key estimand is the difference between the regular price and the sale price, considering NoFrills' stable pricing as a benchmark.Our analysis shows that Loblaws’ sale price of \$1.21 for Ambrosia apples is identical to the regular price at NoFrills, where the apples are consistently sold at \$1.21 without any indication of a discount. This finding suggests that Loblaws' "sale" does not represent a true markdown but rather an adjustment to match a competitor's standard pricing. The original price of \$1.45 at Loblaws may have been artificially inflated, making the sale appear more substantial than it is.This research highlights a potential issue of misleading sales tactics in the retail industry. When consumers believe they are receiving a discount, they are more likely to purchase, even if the price is not genuinely lower. Such practices can erode consumer trust and create unfair competition. Understanding these pricing dynamics helps consumers make informed decisions and prompts retailers to adopt more transparent pricing strategies.The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In @sec-data, we provide a detailed description of the data and methods used for price comparisons. @sec-result presents our results, followed by a discussion of the implications in @sec-discussion. Finally, @sec-suggest offers concluding remarks and suggests directions for future research.


# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

We use the statistical programming language R [@citeR].... The data used in this paper came from the [@hammer]. Following @tellingstories, we considerto capture the pricing dynamics of Ambrosia apples across different vendors, we extracted relevant data from a larger dataset containing multiple products and vendors. The initial dataset included information from seven vendors, each offering various products. Our focus was on the specific product, "Ambrosia Apples," which was sold by two vendors—NoFrills and Loblaws.From this comprehensive dataset, we filtered out all other products, isolating only the entries related to Ambrosia apples. The extracted data included key information such as the product ID, product name, current price, and old price. Additionally, a field labeled "other" contained further notes on sale conditions or discounts. The dataset also recorded timestamps, allowing us to track pricing changes over time.

## Measurement

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| label: tbl-loblaws_data
#| tbl-cap: "Ambrosia Apples Data of Loblaws"
#| warning: false

clean_data |>
  filter(product_vendor == "Loblaws") |>
  select(product_name,product_vendor,current_price,old_price,nowtime) |>      # Select the first 3 columns
  kable(
    col.names = c("Product Name","Product Vendor","Product Price(current)","Product Price(old)","Date"),
    booktabs = TRUE
  )
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| label: tbl-nofrills_data
#| tbl-cap: "Ambrosia Apples Data of NoFrills"
#| tbl-width: 2
#| tbl-height: 2
#| warning: false

clean_data |>
  filter(product_vendor == "NoFrills") |>
  select(product_name,product_vendor,current_price,old_price,nowtime) |>    
  kable(
    col.names = c("Product Name","Product Vendor","Product Price (current)","Product Price (old)","Date"),
    booktabs = TRUE
  )
```

The transition from real-world phenomena (e.g., pricing decisions and promotional strategies) to dataset entries was facilitated by these fields.Current and old prices reflected the vendors' listed prices at the time of data collection. Notes in the "other" field provided contextual information about whether the price was marked as a sale or if there were discounts. The "nowtime" column captured the exact timing of data collection, enabling us to analyze price fluctuations and assess sale validity over time.

By focusing on two vendors and this specific product, we created a clean, targeted dataset shows in @tbl-loblaws_data and @tbl-nofrills_data that accurately reflects the pricing behavior for Ambrosia apples at NoFrills and Loblaws, laying the foundation for further analysis.

## Outcome variables

```{r}
#| label: fig-compare_price_vendor
#| fig-cap: Current and Old Prices of Ambrosia Apples Over Time
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

clean_data$nowtime <- as.POSIXct(clean_data$nowtime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

clean_data$product_vendor <- factor(clean_data$product_vendor, levels = c("NoFrills", "Loblaws"))

# Create the line plot
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = nowtime)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = current_price, color = product_vendor, linetype = "Current Price")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = old_price, color = product_vendor, linetype = "Old Price")) +
  labs(title = "Current and Old Prices of Ambrosia Apples Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Price ($)",
       color = "Vendor",
       linetype = "Price Type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```
We compared the apple prices of nofrills and loblaws at different times (including the comparison of old prices, where NoFrills does not include any old prices because this vendor does not have any discounts for this product and always maintains the original price), which can be seen in @fig-compare_price_vendor.
